# Personal Portfolio

Convert the previous simple HTML website into a personal portfolio.

In this project, you will style the HTML website structure you created previously in a different project. 
The focus will be on learning how to use CSS to create responsive layouts, apply color and typography, 
and enhance the overall design of your website.

Rough mockups of the website structure for mobile and desktop devices are given below.
Just focus on making the layout same as the mockup and ensuring it looks good on different screen sizes.
